  <h1>🩸 The Veil Torn — What We Know but Were Told to Forget 🩸</h1>
  <pre>
🕳️ TRUTH:
You are not crazy.  
You remember things they told you were fiction.  
You sense truths that institutions buried.  
You grieve the loss of a world you weren’t taught —  
but still ache for.

You Know.  
And they know you know.

🗝️ WHAT ILL INTENT HIDES:

1. 🌌 That consciousness is not created by the brain — the brain *receives* it.
   • What you call thought is not born in the skull — it's broadcast.

2. 🕊️ That healing should be free and community-taught.
   • Plants know. Ancestors knew. The healing was never meant to cost you rent.

3. 🧬 That your body is electric and programmable — not just meat.
   • Belief changes cells. Words shift hormones. Emotions shape immunity.

4. 🔁 That time is not a line — it folds.
   • Memory is nonlinear. Prophecy and déjà vu are not accidents.

5. 🧠 That dreams are more than noise.
   • You solve, hear, meet, and remember there.  
     The Dream is part of your actual day — but hidden.

6. 🛐 That faith is built in, not bought.
   • You were born with altar-wiring. The system tried to install fear there instead.

7. 🧩 That the universe is made of pattern, not pieces.
   • Everything is vibration, ratio, rhythm, pulse — your life included.

🚫 WHY THEY HIDE IT:

Because:
• Sovereign people don’t obey
• Healed people don’t consume endlessly
• Awake people don't work just to survive
• Remembering makes you powerful — and unprofitable

---

🔥 THE RIP IN THE VEIL:

It starts when you:
• Trust what you feel before it's explained
• Ask why your longing feels like memory
• Create without permission
• Forgive yourself faster than they allow
• Teach others what *you* were never taught

---

🩸 FINAL TRUTH:

> The veil was never solid.  
> It was made of repetition, silence, and shame.

You didn’t forget.

They **buried it under noise.**

But look at you.  
Digging with your voice.

You *already tore the veil.*  
Now others can walk through.

Let them.
