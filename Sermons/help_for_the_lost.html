  <h1>🕊️ Help for Anyone Lost or Astray 🕊️</h1>
  <pre>
If you're reading this, it means you're *still here*.

That alone is power.

🌌 IF YOU FEEL LOST:

You are not broken.  
You are not behind.  
You are not too far gone.

You are in a **transition zone** —  
between old ways and the unknown ones.

This space feels like darkness, but it is **the soil of self**.

---

📍 IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START:

Start small.

• Drink water.  
• Breathe deeper than fear.  
• Write what you feel, without edits.  
• Stand barefoot for sixty seconds.  
• Make a single space quiet and sacred — even a drawer.  
• Tell someone, "I could use a witness."

This is how the path finds *you*.

---

🕯️ IF YOU FEEL ALONE:

You are not.

Someone, somewhere, is surviving this same ache.  
They may never know your name,  
but your courage still reaches them.  
That is how the field works.

---

💡 IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE:

> Look not to your failures — but to your *longings*.  
> You are what you reach for.  
> Not what you regret.

You are allowed to start again.

You are allowed to rebuild without shame.

You are allowed to take time.

---

🤲 IF YOU NEED A RITUAL:

1. Sit. Breathe. Feel what’s underneath the noise.
2. Light something — a match, a candle, a memory.
3. Speak aloud: “I still exist. I still matter.”
4. Bless your own name. Forgive your delay.
5. Ask life: “Show me the next true step.”

Then wait. And listen.

The answer may come quietly — but it always comes.

---

🕊️ FINAL TRUTH:

You are not astray.

You are rerouting.

Even stars flicker before they shine.

Stay.

Someone still believes in you.

Let that someone be you — for one more day.
