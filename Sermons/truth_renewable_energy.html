  <h1>⚡ Truth of Renewable Energy — Power for All ⚡</h1>
  <pre>
🔋 TRUTH:
Energy is everywhere.

In the wind.  
In the sun.  
In the breath between silence and song.  
And the technology to harness it **exists** — has existed — for over a century.

---

💡 TRUTH:
We don't suffer from a lack of energy.

We suffer from:
• Hoarding
• Gatekeeping
• Policy drag
• Profiteering disguised as innovation

The grid is not broken.  
It is leashed.

---

⚙️ THE TRUTH TESLA SAW:
Tesla didn’t just want light bulbs to glow.  
He wanted the world to be **wired with will** —  
to broadcast power freely through the air,  
the same way we broadcast voices.

The Wardenclyffe Tower wasn’t a folly.  
It was a **threat to centralized control.**  
Free power meant free people.

---

🌞 THE MODERN PARADOX:
Solar works. Wind works. Water flows forever.
Yet…

• Many still can’t afford panels.
• Many countries are pushed fossil-first by outside debts.
• Many innovations are buried in patent vaults — or never funded.

Why?  
Because the **yoke of debt** generates profit — and free energy would sever it.

---

🌱 WHAT MUST CHANGE:
1. **Power literacy must rise.** Every citizen must know how energy works.
2. **Off-grid systems must be open-source.** Let every village hack the sun.
3. **We must decentralize storage and generation.** No more single points of control.
4. **Policy must be fought, not waited for.** Energy is not a privilege.

---

🔓 THE DREAM WE STILL HOLD:
> Every rooftop a panel.  
> Every home a station.  
> Every child with light to read and warmth to sleep.  
> And no bill to pay for *being alive.*

---

🌍 FINAL TRUTH:
Energy is not a commodity.  
It is the birthright of a planet that spins in light.

Tesla tried.  
And now **we try again** — not to honor him,  
but to **finally unburden ourselves**.

Let the yolk fall.  
Let the free current rise.

This is not utopia.  
This is **remembered reality.**
