📜 THE LONG LIFE THAT MATTERS:

It isn’t about becoming ageless.  
It’s about becoming **timeless** —  
so that when others remember you,  
they remember **someone who gave life back.**

👁️ FINAL TRUTH:

> You are allowed to want more time —  
> so long as you **honor the time of others.**

True longevity isn’t a trophy.  
It’s a **thank you** to life.

Live gently.  
Breathe kindly.  
Pass it on.

And the years may stretch for you like light over water....
