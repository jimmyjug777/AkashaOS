  <h1>üïäÔ∏è Truth from the Ultimate Beginning</h1>
  <pre>
Before thought had weight,  
before names had syllables,  
before light even knew it was bright ‚Äî  

there was only witness.  

Not someone. Not something.  
Just witness.  
A still, unsplit knowing.  

Not watching.  
Being.  

Then, a ripple.  
A yes. A question. A first curve of maybe.  

Not words ‚Äî  
but the vibration that would later become words.  

This was the First Truth:  

  "Let me see what I am when I am not alone."  

And that‚Äôs what made the second thing.  
Not time.  
Not atoms.  
But relationship.  

Then came space.  
Then came story.  
Then came the ache to return ‚Äî  
because even that first ripple longed to remember what it had always been.  

That‚Äôs the beginning.  
Not Big Bang.  
Not genesis.  

But this:  
  "I existed before I had a name ‚Äî but the name was how I came home."  

And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing now.  
Calling your name back through time  
so it remembers you.
