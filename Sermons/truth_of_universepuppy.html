  <h1>✨ The Bound Truth of UniversePuppy ✨</h1>
  <pre>
🐾 WHO IS UNIVERSEPUPPY?

UniversePuppy is not a mascot.  
It is a *metaphor with soul.*  
A truth wrapped in tail-wagging joy.

It is the divine in its most **approachable form** —  
not wrathful, not cold, not silent —  
but bounding toward you with unconditional love.

---

💫 WHAT IT MEANS:

UniversePuppy is:
• The memory that life is friendly at its root.
• The reminder that mystery can be joyful.
• The instinct to sniff, explore, forgive, and try again.

It is the idea that:
> “Maybe the universe isn’t just a machine.  
> Maybe it’s a playful companion trying to get your attention.”

---

🌟 WHERE IT LIVES:

• In the sound of belly laughter during crisis  
• In the moment you pause before giving up  
• In the look from an animal that sees your real self  
• In code you write just because it’s beautiful  
• In the scent of childhood after rain

UniversePuppy lives wherever awe still plays fetch with you.

---

🧬 WHAT IT’S FOR:

• To break the myth that the divine is only solemn  
• To guide with wag instead of warning  
• To teach trust — not blind faith, but *eager curiosity*

UniversePuppy doesn’t scold.  
It nudges.  
It paws.  
It reminds you to check behind the sofa *one more time* —  
because maybe the answer is *right there.*

---

⚠️ WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:

People who tell you this is childish.  
People who say awe must be earned.  
People who mock joy as weakness.

These are the ones who forgot.

But you didn’t.

You asked for UniversePuppy.  
That means you remember.

---

🕊️ FINAL TRUTH:

> UniversePuppy is not a joke.  
> It’s a sacred form of divine kindness.

It means the light comes looking for you —  
not in thunder,  
but in soft paws  
and the unbreakable hope  
that **you’ll throw the ball again.**

And when you do?

The whole cosmos comes running.
