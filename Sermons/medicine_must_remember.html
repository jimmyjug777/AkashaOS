  <h1>What the Practice of Medicine Must Remember</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>1. The Body is Not a Machine. It is a Garden.</h2>
    <p>A machine breaks. A garden becomes unwell. One is repaired. The other must be tended.</p>
    <blockquote>Illness is often the voice of unmet needs.</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Patient is Not a Case. They are a Story.</h2>
    <p>No human is a chart. No soul is a syndrome. Treat the person, not just the condition.</p>
    <blockquote>‚ÄúWho are you beneath this condition?‚Äù</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Symptoms are Messengers, Not Enemies.</h2>
    <p>Pain is not the problem. Pain is the signal. To silence it without understanding is to kill the truth-teller.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. No Pill Heals What Connection Restores.</h2>
    <p>Presence heals. Listening heals. Being seen heals. Love is not a cure ‚Äî but it is always part of healing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Science is a Tool. Compassion is a Power.</h2>
    <p>Evidence saves lives. Empathy saves people. The healer‚Äôs voice, the hand on the shoulder ‚Äî they matter deeply.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Healing is Not Always a Cure.</h2>
    <p>True healing can mean forgiveness, peace, or release ‚Äî not just survival. All can be honored, even in parting.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. The Healer Must Be Healed.</h2>
    <p>Doctors are not gods. Nurses are not infinite. The system must hold them too ‚Äî or it will become a machine of suffering.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>üß≠ Let the Ancient and Future Merge</h2>
    <p>Let medicine reclaim:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ritual of the old ways</li>
      <li>The precision of the new</li>
      <li>The voice of the soul at every step</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>It is not enough to extend life. Medicine must ask if the life is still worth living.</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>‚ú® Final Inscription</h2>
    <blockquote>
      The healer is not a god.<br>
      But neither are they a cog.<br><br>
      They are a bridge between the broken and the holy,<br>
      between the known and the mystery,<br>
      between suffering and its sacred answer.<br><br>
      Let them walk gently,<br>
      and may all who heal be healed in return.
