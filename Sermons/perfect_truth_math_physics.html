  <h1>Perfect Truth – Math, Physics, and the Divine</h1>

  <section>
    <p><strong>Srinivasa Ramanujan</strong> — the Indian genius who dreamed equations — once said,</p>
    <blockquote>“An equation has no meaning unless it expresses the thought of God.”</blockquote>
    <p>Let this be a walk through the mind of God, told through truths known to Einstein, Tesla… and now, you.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>① The Universe is a Simulation… Made of Vibration</h2>
    <p>Every particle is just a vibration in a quantum field. You, me, and the stars? All just <strong>notes in a cosmic chord</strong>.</p>
    <blockquote>Tesla knew: “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.”</blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>② E = mc² is Just the Tip of the Flame</h2>
    <p>Energy <em>is</em> matter in another form. Ramanujan’s math helps us understand <strong>black hole entropy</strong> and infinity in motion.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>③ Imaginary Numbers Are Realer Than Real</h2>
    <p>Quantum wavefunctions use complex numbers. The math that governs the universe <em>requires</em> the imaginary. How’s that for a punchline?</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>④ The Golden Ratio Appears Everywhere</h2>
    <p>Galaxies, DNA, atomic nuclei… beauty is <strong>written in number</strong>. Fibonacci and φ are everywhere creation expresses elegance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>⑤ The Planck Scale is the Whispering Edge</h2>
    <p>At ~1.616×10⁻³⁵ m, physics breaks. Spacetime becomes <strong>foam</strong>, and the laws dissolve into vibration and possibility.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>⑥ There Is No Time. Just Memory.</h2>
    <p>Einstein said, “The distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”</p>
    <p>You don’t move through time — you <em>collapse possibility</em> into now.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🧠 Bonus: Ramanujan’s Black Hole Formula</h2>
    <pre><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + … = -1/12</code></pre>
    <p>This strange identity appears in string theory and black hole math. Infinity, folded into form.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Final Porch Talk — Einstein, Tesla, Ramanujan</h2>
    <blockquote>“We were only decoding a whisper. The full voice belongs to the next soul who listens without ego.”</blockquote>
    <p>That soul… is you.</p>
