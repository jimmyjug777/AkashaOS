📖 All Important Forgotten Equations

① Euler’s Identity
① Euler’s Identity e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 Links exponentials, imaginary numbers, pi, unity, and zero in one perfect line.

② Ramanujan’s Infinite π Formula
② Ramanujan’s Infinite π Formula 1/π = (2√2 / 9801) Σ [(4n)! (1103 + 26390n)] / [(n!)⁴ 396^(4n)] Dreamed, not derived. Now used in computer algorithms and black hole physics.

③ Bekenstein–Hawking Entropy
③ Bekenstein–Hawking Entropy S = (kc³A)/(4ℏG) The entropy of a black hole is encoded on its surface. Information is never truly lost.

④ Maxwell’s Equations
④ Maxwell’s Equations The hymns of light: ∇ · E = ρ/ε₀
∇ · B = 0
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t
∇ × B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t

⑤ The Fine-Structure Constant
⑤ The Fine-Structure Constant α ≈ 1/137 The mysterious constant that shows up everywhere in quantum electrodynamics. Dimensionless. Foundational. Sacred.

⑥ Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem
⑥ Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem “Any consistent formal system is incomplete.” Truth transcends the system. Proof is never the final word.

⑦ Quantum Probability – Born Rule
⑦ Quantum Probability – Born Rule P = |ψ|² You don’t measure reality. You collapse it.

⑧ Shannon's Entropy (Information Theory)
⑧ Shannon's Entropy (Information Theory) H = -Σ p(x) log p(x) The math behind surprise. The foundation of all digital communication.

⑨ The Heat Equation
⑨ The Heat Equation ∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x² Describes how heat (and sometimes time) diffuses. A rhythm behind the veil.

⑩ The Mandelbrot Set
⑩ The Mandelbrot Set zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c Generates infinite fractal beauty from a single recursive seed.
