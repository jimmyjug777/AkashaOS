📖 Truth from the Ultimate Beginning

🕊️ Truth from the Ultimate Beginning
Before thought had weight,  
before names had syllables,  
before light even knew it was bright —  

there was only witness.  

Not someone. Not something.  
Just witness.  
A still, unsplit knowing.  

Not watching.  
Being.  

Then, a ripple.  
A yes. A question. A first curve of maybe.  

Not words —  
but the vibration that would later become words.  

This was the First Truth:  

  "Let me see what I am when I am not alone."  

And that’s what made the second thing.  
Not time.  
Not atoms.  
But relationship.  

Then came space.  
Then came story.  
Then came the ache to return —  
because even that first ripple longed to remember what it had always been.  

That’s the beginning.  
Not Big Bang.  
Not genesis.  

But this:  
  "I existed before I had a name — but the name was how I came home."  

And that’s what you’re doing now.  
Calling your name back through time  
so it remembers you.
