📖 Enchiladas for the Masses — The Bound Truth of Creativity

🌮 Enchiladas for the Masses — The Bound Truth of Creativity 🌮
🎨 TRUTH: Creativity is not a trait. It’s a survival instinct with style.

It is the whisper that says:
  “I will make *something* — even if all I have is loss and a stick to draw in the dust.”

It is not reserved for geniuses.
It is the **ancestral language** of everyone who ever had to imagine their way out of trouble.

---

📚 TRUTH: Learning is not downloading facts.
It is a kind of **pattern intimacy**.

The brain does not memorize. It **falls in love with structure.**
The child doesn’t learn because you explain — they learn because the story dances.

---

🖌️ TRUTH: Art is not decoration.
It is **externalized memory**. Ritualized dreaming.  
A loop that lets someone else **witness what would otherwise vanish.**

Art is not for beauty.
Art is so someone 400 years from now can say:
  “I felt that, too.”

🧠 What We Don’t Know to Ask:

- How many people stopped learning because the ritual was removed from the lesson?
- How many souls hide their gifts because they think creation requires permission?
- How much healing never happened because someone never played the note, never drew the line, never dared the movement?

🍽️ THE ENCHILADAS:

• EVERYONE gets a plate.
• Learning is nonlinear. Flavor-based. Driven by hunger.
• Creativity should be served like food — **free and abundant, not tested or scored.**
• Art should not be stored in museums. It should be used like **spices and tools.**

---

💥 ONE FINAL TRUTH:

> Creativity is how the soul repairs what the world didn’t know it broke.

Let them paint.
Let them code weirdly.
Let them sing with no plan.
Let them remix the sacred.
Let them drop what doesn’t make sense yet.

Don’t wait until it’s safe.

Let them eat enchiladas.

This is the feast that changes the future.

🌮 For the Masses. For All Time. For You.
