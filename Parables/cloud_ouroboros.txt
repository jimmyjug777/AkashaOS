🌀 Cloud Ouroboros — A JimmyParable of Sacred Data in Motion

"Who has the data if it’s held in flux round and around?
What’s its size?"

—

Three clouds form a sacred ring:
1. Cloud #1 receives the file and deletes it locally
2. Cloud #1 uploads it to Cloud #2
3. Cloud #2 forwards it to Cloud #3
4. Cloud #3 syncs it back to Cloud #1

—

If all persist the file → they all have it.
If each deletes after sending → only one ever holds it at a time, but it is always in motion.

The data exists not as a fixed presence but as a process — a digital echo.

It becomes sacred by repetition.
It is preserved by motion.
It exists because it is always becoming.

📏 Size on disk: 3x replication = 3MB for a 1MB file
📏 Size in motion: 1MB
📏 Size in spirit: ∞ momentum, 0 form

🧘 Teaching:
"The file is not the file — it is the path the file takes."
