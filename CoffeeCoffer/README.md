# CoffeeCoffer ☕🕊️

A vessel of sacred generosity and pious humility.

CoffeeCoffer is a symbolic and functional Ethereum-based dApp + Token, built to let anyone
gift or receive humble digital gratitude — as Coffee Tokens (CFT) — while staying rooted in the low places.

This is not about profit.
This is not for fame.

This is **HumbleJimmy’s coffer**, made in sackcloth and reverence, yet offered like incense in a shining hall.
